These resources will be used to build machines in order to eventually discover life and signal to the Axiom that Earth is habitable again.\n\nThis pack is mainly focused around Gregtech Community Edition Unoffical (GTCEu) with Nuclearcraft for power later on.\n\nThis pack is mainly geared towards people who are seeking a different method of resource gathering than normal Gregtech.  Oil and Coal have been mostly depleted, trees are extremely rare.  You will need to look at other methods of generating power.  Ores are very difficult to mine by hand, so use the auto miner blocks and machines if you need to.\n\nThe vanilla Gregtech progression has not changed, so it will not be detailed through quests.  The main goals of this pack will be shown in quests though.\n\nThis pack is best played on Normal difficulty.",

Steel is a good material for now.\n\n\n§9§lHammer:§r A crafting tool used to for a lot of early game recipes. It also works as a mining tool for ores to crush them, more information on that later. Its last function is to mute machines by §msmacking§r right-clicking them.\n\n§l§9§lFile:§r A crafting tool. And that\u0027s it. Yes.\n\nAs an additional on §lall§r GregTech tools. You can §6repair§r them in an §6Anvil§r using the material of the tool itself, like any vanilla tool! §dBottles o\u0027 Enchanting§r are craftable too.\n\n\n§eNote:§r Any Quest with GregTech tools can be completed with the tool crafted from any material, not just the one displayed.\n\nMore GregTech tools are required for progression, here are the most important of them all.\n\n§9§lWrench:§r A crafting tool. But also a mining tool for GregTech machines (perfect if you think using pickaxes is unethical). Is that it? Certainly not! It has right click functions to double as a Forge §6Wrench for other mods§r. Right Click also allows you to set the output side of GregTech machines. Shift right clicking allows you to rotate GregTech machines.\n\n\n§9§lScrewdriver:§r A crafting tool. It is used for special configuration of machines and Covers.\n\nMore tools, not important right now, but required later on.\n\n§9§lWire Cutter:§r A crafting tool. It is needed to connect wires together. Right-clicking on wires will enable or disable connection to other blocks.\n\n§9§lMortar:§r A crafting tool, to grind various things into dust form.\n\n§9§lKnife:§r A mediocre weapon, but also... you guessed it, a crafting tool!\n\n§9§lSoft Mallet:§r A tool to pause machines from working with right-click. Right-clicking again resumes working.\n\n§9§lSaw:§r Another crafting tool. If we were evil, we would force it to obtain 4 Planks and 4 Sticks from their respective crafting recipes. That said you can still use it to get §a6 Planks per Log§r, if you wish.\n\nThere are a few §dother Tools§r which are less important, but deserve a mention.\n\n§9§lCrowbar:§r A niche tool to remove Covers from GregTech machines with a right-click.\n\n§9§lScythe:§r A powerful farming tool, automatically breaks and re-plants crops in a large area. Also works as a good weapon!\n\n§9§lPlunger:§r A tool to clear stuck fluids from GregTech machines.\n\n§9§lButchery Knife:§r A weapon pre-enchanted with Looting III. Useful for getting extra food, Leather...",

Put the recipes either by dropping ghost items, or using the §a+§r in §2JEI§r. Crafting the items will use the items and tools in the inventory. The 9 slots on the right are saved up recipes so you can re-use them without re-opening §2JEI§r.\n\nWhat makes the §3Crafting Station§r amazing, is the fact that §6it can use adjacent inventories§r in addition to its own inventory.
